# 🏥 ClinicCare Console - Java SE Project

## 📌 Overview

**ClinicCare Console** is a simple Java SE (Standard Edition) console application designed for small clinic environments. It helps clinic staff manage patients, doctors, and appointments directly from the terminal without the need for a graphical interface.

This system is ideal for educational purposes and showcases the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Java Collections, File I/O, and Exception Handling in a real-world scenario.
